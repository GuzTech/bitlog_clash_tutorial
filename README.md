# Bitlog Clash tutorial
This repository contains all the code used in the [Clash](http://www.clash-lang.org) tutorial at the [Bitlog](https://bitlog.it) technology blog. The master branch is for Clash 0.7.2, while the newest version is 0.99. Due to some minor breaking changes, I'm sticking with 0.7.2 for now. In due time, the code will be updated for Clash 0.99.

## Repository structure
There is a folder called "part_X" for each part of the tutorial. Below is a list of links to the parts:

1. [Part 1 - Basic introduction](https://bitlog.it/hardware/a-basic-introduction-to-clash-for-fpga-development/)

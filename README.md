# Bitlog Clash tutorial
This repository contains all the code used in the [Clash](http://www.clash-lang.org) tutorial at the [Bitlog](https://bitlog.it) technology blog. The master branch is for [Clash 0.7.2](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude-0.11.2), while the newest version is [Clash 0.99](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude-0.99). Due to some minor breaking changes, I'm sticking with 0.7.2 for now. In due time, the code will be updated for Clash 0.99.

## Repository structure
There is a folder called "part_X" for each part of the tutorial. Below is a list of links to the parts:

1. [Part 1 - Basic introduction to combinatorial logic](https://bitlog.it/hardware/a-basic-introduction-to-clash-for-fpga-development/)
2. [Part 2 - Bug fixes, much cleaner code, simulation, and clocked logic](https://bitlog.it)
